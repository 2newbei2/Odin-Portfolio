# Landing Page Project

This project is a recreation of a simple landing page design. As a new learner in web development, my primary goal was to practice structuring a webpage with semantic HTML and styling it with modern CSS. The main focus of the CSS implementation was to use **Flexbox** for creating the page layout.

This exercise helped me solidify my understanding of fundamental front-end concepts.

## Features

The webpage is divided into several distinct sections:
*   A clean header with a logo and navigation links.
*   A "hero" section with a prominent title, text, a call-to-action button, and an image placeholder.
*   An "information" section with cards displaying images and text.
*   A "quote" section to display an inspiring message.
*   A final "call-to-action" (CTA) section.
*   A simple footer with copyright information.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3**
    *   **Flexbox**: Used extensively for layout and alignment across all sections.
    *   **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)**: For managing the color scheme efficiently.
    *   **Media Queries**: To provide a basic responsive layout for smaller screens.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained practical experience with:

*   **HTML Structure**: Using semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to create a well-organized and accessible document.
*   **Flexbox**: This was the core of the project. I learned how to use Flexbox to create complex layouts, align items both horizontally and vertically, and manage space between elements using properties like `display: flex`, `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `gap`.
*   **CSS Styling**: Applying various CSS properties to match the design, including colors, fonts, padding, margins, and borders.
*   **CSS Variables**: Using `:root` to define a color palette, which makes it easy to maintain and update the theme.
*   **Responsive Design**: Implementing a simple media query to adjust the layout for smaller screens, ensuring a better user experience on mobile devices.
*   **The Box Model**: A deeper understanding of the box model and the utility of `box-sizing: border-box;` which was applied globally.

## How to Use
